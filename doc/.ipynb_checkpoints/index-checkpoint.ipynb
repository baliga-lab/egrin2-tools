      "This \"*Wiki*\" is an iPython notebook, which means that code, visualizations, and other neat stuff are directly embedded. The documents will teleport you to quick results and predictions or, if you need to go deeper, they will help guide you towards mastery. You can download these files or copy snippets of code, modify them, and run them on your machine to make them do what you want. Think of it as a living template.\n",
