    "*Good! You've come to the right place.*\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already developed ensembles for several commonly studied microbes, including *E. coli* and *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. Consult our [list of available ensembles](../check_dbs.ipynb) to see if we've already developed a model for your organism. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't see your organism listed, it's time to think about building an ensemble of your own. The tools described here will help you do that provided you have or can assemble a compendium of transcriptome profiles (e.g hundreds of microarrays). Larger datasets are generally better. If you need help, you can [contact us](https://www.systemsbiology.org/baliga-group) for guidance. \n",

    "\n",
    "An EGRIN 2.0 ensemble is the result of running `cMonkey2` (a non-deterministic, integrated biclustering algorithm) many times to infer highly-accurate, condition-specfic gene regulatory networks. \n",

    "\n",
    "<h3> What do the `BUILD` tools do? </h3> \n",
    "\n",
    "These tools help build custom ensembles. In short, they automatically configure cMonkey2 runs and generate QSub scripts for submitting many `cMonkey2` jobs to a Sun Grid Engine (SGE) scheduler.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tools generate cMonkey2 runs with slightly different parameterizations for training on subsets of the available experimental data. If you supply `BLOCK` definitions for the experimental conditions, including `INCLUSION BLOCKS` and `EXCLUSION BLOCKS`, the subsets of experimental data can be chosen intelligently. More about this in the [tutorial](build_tutorial_1.ipynb). \n",

    "- [cMonkey2](https://github.com/baliga-lab/cmonkey2/wiki) installed on that cluster.\n",
