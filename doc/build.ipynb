The tools described here will help you do that provided you have or can assemble a compendium of transcriptome profiles (e.g hundreds of microarrays). Larger datasets are generally better. If you need help, you can [contact us](https://www.systemsbiology.org/baliga-group) for guidance. \n",

Essentially it is the product of running cMonkey2 (a non-deterministic, integrated biclustering) many times to subsets of your experimental data and then applying some graphic theoretic principles to infer a highly accurate, condition-specfic gene regulatory network. \n",
