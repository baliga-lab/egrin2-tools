Query
=====

The QUERY functions are the most commonly used tools in the EGRIN 2.0 ecosystem.

Currently, there are two categories of QUERY functions available:


1. Mine
-------

Mining functions query the EGRIN 2.0 ensemble for relationships in the ensemble. These include bicluster co-membership relationships, corem memberships, and motif locations.

2. Plot
-------

As the name suggests, the Plotting functions visualize data and relationships in the EGRIN 2.0 ensemble.

Currently this is restricted to visualizing array data (e.g., gene expression) as lines, heatmaps, and barplots.
