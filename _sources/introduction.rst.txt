What is an EGRIN 2.0 ensemble ?
-------------------------------

EGRIN 2.0 ensembles are predictive models of how and when genes are co-regulated in microorganisms.

To learn more about the underlying biological motivation for this type of model you can read `our paper <http://msb.embopress.org/content/10/7/740.long>`_ or check out our previous `web resource <http://egrin2.systemsbiology.net/>`_.

What's different here ?
-----------------------

Good question. We wanted to put you back in control. We wanted you to query the models in whatever way is appropriate for your biological question. That's what you can do here.
